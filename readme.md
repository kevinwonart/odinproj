# Odin Project

## Introduction

Using Odin Project to fill in gaps in HTML/CSS basics/intermediate concepts and progress in fullstack roadmap. At the point of creating this repo I have created and finished my Tictactoe minimax app using the React Library. I find the css and html to be clunky and have issues with its media queries and it's consistency throughout the project. I am trying Odin Project to cover different bases of my understanding.
Taking a few steps back to take more steps forward.

## Goals

- To solidify my understanding of HTML and CSS.
- To identify and learn areas within these technologies that I might have missed or need improvement.
- To document my learning journey for future reference and for others who might find it helpful.
- Delve into fullstack development.
